        UKRI Living Benchmarks is creating and curating open-source benchmarks that support
        the procurement and performance assessment of high-performance computing systems.
        The suite of benchmarks can be drawn from for systems across all performance tiers.
        Living Benchmarks is also building community skills and capabilities that support benchmarking.

        The project is supported by the [UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure Programme](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/digital-research-infrastructure/)
        under grant APP46895.
